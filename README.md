Abstract:
Sorting, generally, stands for an arranging the elements of an array or list so that they are placed in some relevant order which may be either ascending or descending.
Again, sorting is any process of arranging items systematically, and has two common, yet distinct meanings: ordering: arranging items in a sequence ordered by some criterion; categorizing: grouping items with similar properties.
This presentation is about Heap, Quck, and Shell sorting algorithms.
